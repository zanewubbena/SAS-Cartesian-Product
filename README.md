# SAS Cartesian Product

If you're like me, then you probably never could've imagined a scenario when youâ€™d use the Cartesian product. So, I was quite surprised when I found the Cartesian product useful for solving a number of analytical problems when programming in [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html). 

Here I discuss using the Cartesian product in SAS to solve just one of those problems. 

## What is the Cartesian product?

The essence of the Cartesian product is that we can use sets to make new sets that contain all pair elements of the initial sets. What does that mean? Good question! Supposed we have two sets: A and B. Each set denoted by eitehr A or B contains elements. These elements could be anything but for this example we'll use letters. So set A has the following elements a, b, and c. And, set B has the following elements, d, e, and f. The Cartesian product allows us to find all possible combinations of the elements in both set A and B. So the Cartesian product of set A and set B is A x B, which creates a new set that contains all paired combinations (or ordered pairs). Because set A had 3 elements and set B had 3 elements, there are a total of 9 ordered pairs (3 x 3 = 9).

## Scenario



Create table of all possible 2019 determination level (DL) values
```
data a_table;
	input DL $  DL2019;
	datalines;
	DL0 0
	DL1 1
	DL2 2
	DL3 3
	DL4 4
	;
run;
```


Create table of all possible 2020 determination level (DL) values

```
data b_table;
	input DL $ DL2020;
	datalines;
	DL1 1
	DL2 2
	DL3 3
	DL4 4
	;
run;
```

Create the cartesian product using both 2019 DLs and 2020 DLs

```
proc sql;
	create table cartesian_dl (drop=DL) as
	select *
	from a_table, b_table;
quit;
```
